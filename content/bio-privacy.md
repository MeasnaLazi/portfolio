# Privacy Policy for Bio
**Last Updated:** January 29, 2026

## 1. Introduction
**Bio** ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. We designed Bio to be **private by default**. We do not sell your personal data. This policy explains how your information is handled.

## 2. Data Storage & Sync
* **Local Storage:** Your journal entries, photos, and transcripts are stored locally on your device using Apple's secure storage technologies.
* **iCloud Sync:** If you enable cloud features, your data is synced to your personal private iCloud container. We do not have access to your iCloud data.

## 3. Voice Data & Transcription
* **On-Device Processing:** We use Apple's built-in speech recognition technology (`SFSpeechRecognizer`) to transcribe your voice notes.
* **Privacy:** This processing happens directly on your device. Your audio recordings are **not** sent to our servers or any third party for transcription purposes.

## 4. AI Features (Writing Assistant & Smart Features)
To provide features like "Write Note," "Feedback & Change," and "Grammar Check," Bio processes specific note you select.
* **Data Transmission:** When you use an AI feature, the text content is transmitted securely to our backend system.
* **Third-Party Providers:** Our backend may utilize third-party Large Language Models (LLMs), including but not limited to **Google Gemini** and **OpenAI (ChatGPT)**, to process your request.
* **Data Usage:** Your data is used solely to generate the response and is not used to train these third-party models.

## 5. Your Rights
You retain full ownership of your data. You may delete your data at any time by deleting the entry within the app or uninstalling the application.
